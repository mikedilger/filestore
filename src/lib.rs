//! `filestore` is a crate that handles storage and retrieval of files.
//! Files are stored along with a filename, retrieved via a key issued
//! at storage.  Content is deduplicated at storage time, so only one
//! copy of each distinct file is stored, with potentially multiple
//! references to it.
